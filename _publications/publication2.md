### Summary
We show how quadruply lensed GW events (which already come with good localization) can be used to constrain modified GW propagation without prior knowledge of H<sub>0</sub> already at 2G detectors, with the prospects greatly improving at 3G detectors.

### Contribution
I produced most of the results and figures within this paper, wrote the necessary code, and also contributed to the development of the theoretical framework.

### Abstract
It has been recently shown that quadruply lensed gravitational-wave (GW) events due to coalescing binaries can be localized to one or just a few galaxies, even in the absence of an electromagnetic counterpart. We discuss how this can be used to extract information on modified GW propagation, which is a crucial signature of modifications of gravity at cosmological scales. We show that, using quadruply lensed systems, it is possible to constrain the parameter &Xi;<sub>0</sub> that characterizes modified GW propagation, without the need of imposing a prior on 
H<sub>0</sub>. A LIGO/Virgo/Kagra network at target sensitivity might already get a significant measurement of &Xi;<sub>0</sub>, while a third-generation GW detector such as the Einstein Telescope could reach a very interesting accuracy.
