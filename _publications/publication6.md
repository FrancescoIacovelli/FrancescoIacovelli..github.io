### Summary
We review how different &gamma;-ray burst emission models predict different polarization angles of the jet, and study how GRB polarimetry measurements can be complemented by GW observations both at 2G and 3G detectors in order to obtain information on the GRB mechanism. We find that, although unlikely in the near future,  already a single joint detection could allow us to rule out most of the emission models.

### Contribution
I produced the results and plots of the gravitational wave part, also participating in the theoretical development of the paper.

### Abstract
The last decade has seen the emergence of two new fields within astrophysics: gamma ray polarimetry and GW astronomy. The former, which aims to measure the polarization of gamma rays in the energy range of 10s to 100s of keV, from astrophysical sources, saw the launch of the first dedicated polarimeters such as GAP and POLAR. On the other hand, GW astronomy started with the detection of the first black hole mergers by LIGO in 2015, followed by the first multi messenger detection in 2017. While the potential of the two individual fields has been discussed in detail in the literature, the potential for joint observations has thus far been ignored. In this article, we aim to define how GW observations can best contribute to gamma ray polarimetry and study the scientific potential of joint analyses. In addition we aim to provide predictions on feasibility of such joint measurements in the near future. We study which GW observables can be combined with measurements from gamma ray polarimetry to improve the discriminating power regarding GRB emission models. We then provide forecasts for the joint detection capabilities of current and future GW detectors and polarimeters. Our results show that by adding GW data to polarimetry, a single precise joint detection would allow to rule out the majority of emission models. We show that in the coming years joint detections between GW and gamma ray polarimeters might already be possible. Although these would allow to constrain part of the model space, the probability of highly constraining joint detections will remain small in the near future. However, the scientific merit held by even a single such measurement makes it important to pursue such an endeavour. Furthermore, we show that using the next generation of GW detectors, such as the Einstein Telescope, joint detections for which GW data can better complement the polarization data become possible.
