Ph.D. student, gravitational waves and cosmology focused, actively involved in third-generation gravitational-wave detectors, Sunday hiker if time allows. 

## Professional

I am currently working under the supervision of <a href="https://fiteoweb.unige.ch/~maggiore/" target="_blank">Michele Maggiore</a>. The core focus of my research activity is the theoretical study of the new and promising field of **gravitational waves**. I am mainly focusing
on the possibility of using them for **cosmological purposes** and to test **modifications
of the theory of General Relativity**. Moreover, as a member of the Observational Science Board, I am working on forecasting the capabilities of the **<a href="https://www.et-gw.eu" target="_blank">Einstein Telescope</a>** to observe different kinds of sources and extract information about their origin and structure, also publishing (hopefully!) useful [**codes**]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/code.md %}). I also recently started collaborating on the exciting **<a href="http://lgwa.unicam.it" target="_blank">Lunar Gravitational-wave Antenna</a>** project, trying to characterize its scientific output.

I also enjoy (nature) photography and a good tennis match.
