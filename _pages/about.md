# Francesco Iacovelli
Ph.D. student, gravitational waves and cosmology focused, actively involved in third-generation gravitational-wave detectors, Sunday hiker if time allows. 

## Professional

I am currently working under the supervision of [Michele Maggiore](https://fiteoweb.unige.ch/~maggiore/). The core focus of my research activity is the theoretical study of the new and promising field of **gravitational waves**. I am mainly focusing
on the possibility of using them for **cosmological purposes** and to test **modifications
of the theory of General Relativity**. Moreover, as a member of the Observational Science Board, I am working on forecasting the capabilities of the [**Einstein Telescope**](https://www.et-gw.eu) to observe different kinds of sources and extract information about their origin and structure, also publishing (hopefully!) useful **codes**. I also recently started collaborating on the exciting [**Lunar Gravitational-Wave Antenna**](http://lgwa.unicam.it) project, trying to characterize its scientific output.

I also enjoy (nature) photography and a good tennis match.
