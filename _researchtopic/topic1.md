## Overview
<a href="https://www.et-gw.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Einstein Telescope</a> (ET) is the proposed European third-generation ground-based gravitational wave detector. Thanks to an improvement by more than one order of magnitude in sensitivity as compared to current detectors and a broader frequency range, ET has the potential to trigger revolutions in Astrophysics, Fundamental Physics, and Cosmology *(it is amazing, isn't it?)*.

Thanks to the knowledge we acquired on the population of merging compact objects from LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, it is now possible to produce sensible forecasts of the ET capabilities (*obviously without forgetting about <a href="https://cosmicexplorer.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cosmic Explorer</a> (CE) on the other side of the Atlantic!*), exploring in greater detail its vast science case and further strengthening it. 

## How do I contribute?

As a member of the ET Observational Science Board, I extensively worked on different aspects of ET's science case. In particular, together with the Geneva group, I developed [*GWFAST*]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _code/software_package2.md %}) [[4]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _publications/publication4.md %})], one of the few public Fisher-matrix codes capable of simulating how ET will reconstruct the parameters of the huge number of compact binary events it will detect *(10<sup>5</sup> per year!)*. Inference requirements are indeed more stringent than detection ones and should carefully be analyzed (see e.g. [[7]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _publications/publication7.md %})]).

Last year I produced state-of-the-art forecasts for ET and CE's observational capabilities for mergers of black holes and neutron stars [[5]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _publications/publication5.md %})]. I then made a significant contribution to the development of [[8]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _publications/publication8.md %})], in which different ET designs were considered *(computational speed was a key requirement!)*.

I have also worked on more dedicated aspects of the ET science case with leading experts in the fields (primordial black holes [[9]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _publications/publication9.md %})], neutron star equation of state [[10]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _publications/publication10.md %})], Pop. III stars [[14]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _publications/publication14.md %})]) and keep on working on **new topics** (recently **stochastic backgrounds** and **GR testing** at small scales) with new amazing collaborators!
