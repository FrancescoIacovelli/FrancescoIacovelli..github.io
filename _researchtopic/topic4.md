## Overview
The <a href="http://lgwa.unicam.it" target="_blank">Lunar Gravitational-wave Antenna</a> (LGWA) is a mission proposal to measure thanks to an array of seismometers the vibrations of the Moon caused by GWs, exploiting its seismic quietness. 

Such a detector would be sensitive between a few mHz and a few Hz, thus bridging the gap between the <a href="https://www.elisascience.org" target="_blank">Laser Interferometer Space Antenna</a> (LISA) mission and ground-based detectors. Having access to this frequency band means having access to objects in a different mass range, and potentially new sources, making it of great interest for cosmological, fundamental physics, and astrophysical studies.

## How do I contribute?

I recently joined the LGWA project, contributing to the development of a “white paper” containing a vast study of both the scientific and technological prospects of this mission. In particular, I have been assigned a coordination role for the cosmology section, and I am also working on the observational and multiband capabilities of this experiment.
