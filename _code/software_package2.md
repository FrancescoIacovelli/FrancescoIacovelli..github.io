## Summary
Fisher-matrix package to forecast the detection capabilities of gravitational-wave detector networks for compact binary observations, giving the possibility to compute signal-to-noise ratios and statistical measurement errors on the source parameters. Written in *Python* and based on automatic differentiation.
